    "\n",
    "    Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and reads like plain english\n",
    "    Important note is that in python, the most important thing are indents.  Improper indents WILL cause errors\n",
    "Basic Types\n",
    "\n",
    "    During this lessson plan we will be using a few different types\n",
    "        String: a sequence of letters and symbols surrounded by \"\"\n",
    "        Integer: whole number (eg 5)\n",
    "        float: number with decimal places (eg 5.3)\n",
    "        Object: a special type that has its own methods we can use - \n",
    "        a method is a series of lines of code that accomplishes some task\n",
    "        Dataframe: special object imported by the pandas library, allows us\n",
    "        to create a relational way of viewing and manipulating data\n",
    "        Series/List: simply a list of some form of data\n",

    "What does Import do?\n",
    "\n",
    "    the import statement gives us functions, objects or a set of objects and functions (known as a\n",
    "    library) that other people created that we would like to use.\n",
