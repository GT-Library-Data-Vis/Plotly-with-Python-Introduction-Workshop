# Plotly-with-Python-Introductory-Workshop
Using Plotly API for python in order to create a 3D scatter plot
Here I will explain the contents of this workbook
You can download and use the i python files included (plotly_workshop_new) to run my commands on 
jupyter notebook.  This is the easiest way to see a step by step workthrough of the code.
If you would like a simpler way to run the commands, just use the .py files, these should run as long as python 3.X, Plotly,
Numpy, and Pandas are installed.
Important - This code will not run unless you have an account with plotly and input your own Username and API Key
You can retrieve this info from your online plotly account under Settings -> API Keys.
